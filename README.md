# Start a new Scala Project!

This is a quick-setup. It has a `build.sbt` with sensible settings and the most 
recent versions of various libraries (automatically updated by [scala-steward](https://github.com/fthomas/scala-steward)),
a files structure, `.gitignore` and a few plugins. 

To start, delete those dependencies you don't need and begin hacking ðŸš€
